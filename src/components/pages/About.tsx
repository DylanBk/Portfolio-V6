                        <p className='leading-4.5'>
                            I'm Dylan, a 17-year-old college student studying Digital Production, Design, and Development.
                            <br /><br />I love designing sleek, modern UIs and bringing them to life as functional products.
                            <br /><br />As someone who enjoys writing code for both the backend and frontend sections of websites, I am going down the full stack development route, and loving every step of the journey.
                            <br /><br />Beyond web development, I have discovered a new joy in working with data; I like to write scripts that process data and convert it into a human-friendly, visual format, ie creating dashboards for user behaviour.
                            <br /><br />Aside from coding, I'm often working out at the gym, reading, or playing games. I also like to cook meals and enjoy eating them even more.

                        <p className='leading-4.5'>
                        I have been working to master React and TypeScript and integrate them with Next.js, this brings about new challenges such as learning server-side rendering which I look forward to as I am interested in making more performance-friendly, scalable websites for larger projects.
                        <br /><br />I also aim to master Pandas and SQL as I enjoy working with data and building data-driven projects like dashboards, analytics tools, etc. I find it rewarding to transform raw data into something that people can understand and use.

                        <p className="leading-4.5">
                        In my future, I see myself building digital solutions to improve people's lives. As someone who finds joy in helping others and making their lives easier, I aim to be in a web development role, likely front end initially but I plan to transition into full stack development as I enjoy working on both the front and back end.
                        <br /><br />I hope to create tools that empower people, whether that be in work, personal life, or wherever they need some support.
